## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have learn a lot of things especially on CSS Flexbox, and coding a design. It's a great experience for a student like me (as of now I'm a 4th year BSIT student) for making me code like a frontend dev. Tho this is only a beginner's project, it's a good practice to learn more about the fundamentals of frontend development


### Continued development

I will try and do learn more about complex frontend coding like adding some Javascript on my future projects and create more cool projects with the help of Frontend Mentor


### Useful resources

- W3Schools(https://www.w3school.com) - This helped me for refreshing some basic html and css codes that I forgot. I will keep on making this website as a reference as it provide detailed guide.
